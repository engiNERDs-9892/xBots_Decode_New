## Code Modification Policy

**IMPORTANT: Only make code changes to files in the TeamCode directory.**

- All code modifications, edits, and new file creation must be limited to the `TeamCode/` directory and its subdirectories.
- Do not modify files outside of TeamCode, including but not limited to:
  - Files in `FtcRobotController/`
  - Build configuration files (`build.gradle`, `build.common.gradle`, `build.dependencies.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradle.properties`)
  - Git configuration files
  - Documentation files outside TeamCode
  - Any other files outside the TeamCode directory

- If a user requests changes outside TeamCode, inform them that only TeamCode modifications are allowed and suggest alternative approaches within TeamCode if applicable.
